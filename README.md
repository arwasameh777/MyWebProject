🚀 My First Web Development Project – Glammyland 🚀

I’m thrilled to share Glammyland, my very first front-end project built entirely with HTML & CSS! This project marks an important milestone in my web development journey, representing my first hands-on experience creating a real webpage.

✨ About the Project

Glammyland is a simple, clean, and user-friendly website showcasing a collection of Sheglam Makeup products. The goal was to design a mini product display page that highlights different makeup items in a neat and professional layout—just like a real e-commerce brand.

-💡 Key Features

-🎨 Gradient header with a welcoming brand identity

-💄 Product showcase featuring Sheglam items (mascara, blush, foundation, concealer, highlighter, lip oils)

-🖱️ Clickable links for each product

-📱 Responsive design for viewing across devices

-🌸 Clean, minimal layout for a smooth user experience

🔧 What I Learned

-Structuring a webpage with semantic HTML

-Styling with CSS selectors, gradients, and flexbox

-Maintaining design consistency and spacing for readability

-Building a simple product showcase layout

🌟 Next Steps

I’m excited to learn JavaScript to add interactivity, and later move on to React for more advanced web applications. This is just the beginning, and I’m motivated to keep improving every day! 💪
